## Bots for DeltaChat

Bots are Delta Chat’s bridges into the rest of the world.

They extend Delta Chat with functionality by using Delta Chat messages as input and output. Typically, they connect to other chat protocols, fetch data from the web, or play a game with you. But really there is no limit other than what a computer can do.

A Delta Chat bot only needs a running computer and a network connection. That might be a server in a data center, your laptop, or a Raspberry Pi at home. Most bots don’t even need a publicly reachable IP-address or port.
